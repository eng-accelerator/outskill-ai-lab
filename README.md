# Outskill AI Lab
_Developed and maintained by [Ishan Dutta](https://github.com/ishandutta0098)_

## About
The Outskill AI Lab was started in 2025 as an effort to build elaborate projects which would span
across AI Agents, RAGs and more. 
    
The goal of the lab is to build high quality projects with robust documentation and clean code. 
  
Since this is just the beginning, the repository structure might get significant structural and functional
changes from time to time. 
  
If you would like to become a contributor by adding/improving features to existing projects or by working
on new projects just raise an issue and we can discuss it there!

## Setup

### 1. Environment File
You will need to create a `.env` in the root of the project.  
This will store all the required environment variables required to run the project.  
  
Refer to `dummy.env` in the root folder to see what all is required.  
Different projects use different frameworks/api/etc. so accordingly you can fill the fields.
  
### 2. Virtual Environment
The entire project is run using `uv` as a package manager.
